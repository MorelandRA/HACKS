### Hardware-Automated Cooperative Keypress System
---
The goal for this project is to develop a raspberry pi middleman between my peripheral devices and my computer.

Though it will begin as a pass-through device, my long-term goal is to develop an advanced automation and macro system which works alongside the user.

More details to come.
